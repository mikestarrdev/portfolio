# Welcome to my Portfolio!

The purpose of this app is to demonstrate "proof of work," and to showcase my skills as a developer. This portfolio itself is meant to be a project that shows off my CSS, HTML and React skills.

Many of my colleagues recommended I used a template to build this portfolio. I decided that it'd be more fun, and a better learning experience if I created the entire app from scratch!

Technologies used:

- create-react-app for React initialization
- Tailwind CSS - most of the CSS was written from scratch

Challenges, wins:

- Creating the Projects component took a lot of trial and error. It was a great exercise in using breakpoints
- This project has been a great way to practice Tailwind CSS
