# Welcome to my portfolio site!

The purpose of this app is demonstrate my "proof of work," and to showcase my skills. Many of my colleagues recommended I use a template to build my portfolio, but I decided that it'd be more fun, and a better learning experience if I created the entire app from scratch!

Technologies used:
- create-react-app for React initialization
- Tailwind CSS - most of the CSS was written from scratch

Challenges, wins:
- Creating the Projects component took a lot of trial and error. It was a great exercise in using breakpoints
- This project has been a great way to practice Tailwind CSS
